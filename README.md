# Money Matters: Exploring the State of Financial Well-Being in the U.S-Capstone Project
### Overview
- This capstone project explores the factors affecting financial well-being and develops a machine learning model to predict financial well-being scores.
- The analysis involves using Python for data processing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, and Power BI for analyzing demographic factors.
### Guiding Questions
1. How do demographic factors such as household income, education level, age, generation, and ethnicity affect an individual’s financial well-being score?
2. How do individuals’ beliefs and knowledge about financial concepts, such as investment risks, interest rates, and mortgage terms, impact their financial well-being scores?
3. How can we develop a machine learning model that integrates both demographic factors and individuals’ beliefs and knowledge about financial concepts to accurately predict financial well-being scores?
