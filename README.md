# Money Matters: Exploring the State of Financial Well-Being in the U.S-Capstone Project
### Overview
- This capstone project explores the factors affecting financial well-being and develops a machine learning model to predict financial well-being scores.
- The analysis involves using Python for data processing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, and Power BI for analyzing demographic factors.
### Guiding Questions
1. How do demographic factors such as household income, education level, age, generation, and ethnicity affect an individual’s financial well-being score?
2. How do individuals’ beliefs and knowledge about financial concepts, such as investment risks, interest rates, and mortgage terms, impact their financial well-being scores?
3. How can we develop a machine learning model that integrates both demographic factors and individuals’ beliefs and knowledge about financial concepts to accurately predict financial well-being scores?
4. ### Approach
5. #### Data Processing and Analysis with Python
   - Data Processing: Used Python for data cleaning and preparation.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted exploratory analysis to identify patterns and relationships.
   - Visualization: Created visualizations to understand how beliefs and knowledge about financial concepts impact financial well-being scores.
  #### Power BI Analysis
  - Demographic Analysis: Used Power BI to create visualizations and dashboards analyzing the impact of demographic factors such as household income, education level, age, generation, and ethnicity on financial well-being scores.
  - Dashboards: Created interactive dashboards to visualize and explore demographic data.
